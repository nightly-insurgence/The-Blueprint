3. Objectives
   - Primary goal: Increase the proportion of locally-produced plant-based calories in the Tunisian diet by (#TODO) within (#TODO) years.
   - Secondary goals: Improve public health, reduce water usage in agriculture, decrease dependence on food imports.

4. Proposed Changes
   - Implement a "Tunisian Plant-Based Nutrition Initiative" to:
     a) Provide incentives for farmers to increase production of locally befitting crops
     b) Introduce a public health campaign promoting the benefits of lowering meat consuption
     d) Invest in research and development for drought-resistant plant crops

5. Implementation
   - Timeline: Phased approach over 3 years
     Year 1: Legislation and initial incentives
     Year 2: Health campaign and school meal program changes
     Year 3: Full implementation and R&D investments

7. Potential Challenges
   - Changing dietary habits
   - Challenging big players in food production

8. Budgetary Implications
   - Estimated costs: (#todo)
   - Potential savings: (#todo) (reduction in healthcare costs)

   - Potential supporters: Health organizations, environmental groups, traditional farmers
   - Potential opponents: Meat importers, modern fast-food chains

10. Evaluation Metrics
    - Key performance indicators: Percentage of locally-produced plant-based calories in diet, obesity rates, agricultural water usage
    - Measurement methods: National dietary surveys, health statistics, agricultural reports

11. Legal Considerations
    - (#todo)
